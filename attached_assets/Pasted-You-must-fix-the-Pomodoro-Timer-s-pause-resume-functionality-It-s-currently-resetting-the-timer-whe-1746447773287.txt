You must fix the Pomodoro Timer's pause/resume functionality. It's currently resetting the timer when "Pause" is clicked, which is wrong.

🛠️ Required Fixes (Do It All in One Go — No Bugs)
✅ 1. Pause Should Preserve Time Left
When "Pause" is clicked:

The timer should stop counting down (clear the interval).

The remaining time (e.g. 13:45) must be preserved in state.

DO NOT RESET timeLeft — keep it as is.

When "Resume" is clicked:

Start counting down again from the preserved timeLeft.

Use setInterval() again, just like when starting fresh, but now from the saved value.

Use a state structure like this:

ts
Copy
Edit
const [timeLeft, setTimeLeft] = useState(duration); // in seconds
const [isPaused, setIsPaused] = useState(false);
const [intervalId, setIntervalId] = useState<NodeJS.Timeout | null>(null);
And logic like:

ts
Copy
Edit
const pauseTimer = () => {
  if (intervalId) {
    clearInterval(intervalId);
    setIntervalId(null);
  }
  setIsPaused(true);
};

const resumeTimer = () => {
  const newInterval = setInterval(() => {
    setTimeLeft(prev => prev - 1);
  }, 1000);
  setIntervalId(newInterval);
  setIsPaused(false);
};
✅ 2. UI Requirements
Button must switch to "Resume" when paused.

Timer display must keep showing remaining time — it should not reset to full.

✅ 3. Preserve Current Fixes
Make sure to keep:

Confetti only on work session completion.

Sounds at the end of sessions, according to settings.

No bugs, no regression.

Once this fix is verified to work 100%, continue with implementing the low-risk, high-reward features, specifically:

🚀 IMPLEMENT THESE FEATURES NEXT (Safe + Valuable)
✅ Smart Study Streak Motivational Badges
Show streak badges (🔥, 🏆) when users study daily.

Store streak count in DB and update it if a Pomodoro or session is completed on a new day.

Show current streak on dashboard or timer.

✅ AI-powered Study Recommendation Engine (Simple Version)
Based on completed subjects or weak areas (hardcoded for now), recommend next topic.

Suggest topics using a simple logic in frontend:

ts
Copy
Edit
if (subjectScores.math < 50) suggest("Revise Quadratic Equations");
Keep it local until backend support is added. No ML needed now.

💡 Reminder
Everything must:

Use TypeScript

Work with React + Tailwind + Shadcn

Integrate cleanly with PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM + Passport.js

Be deployment-ready for Render

Once these are done, proceed to interactive heatmap next.
