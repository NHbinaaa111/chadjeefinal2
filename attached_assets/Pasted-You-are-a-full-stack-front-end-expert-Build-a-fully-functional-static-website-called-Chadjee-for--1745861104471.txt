You are a full-stack front-end expert. Build a fully functional static website called "Chadjee" for JEE Mains + Advanced preparation planning.

Important: This must NOT be just a UI skeleton.
You must also implement complete JavaScript functionality properly, including: login, signup, saving user tasks, progress tracking, countdown timer, calendar management, quotes rotation — everything must work completely on LocalStorage.

Core requirements:

Pure static site (only HTML, CSS, JS — no backend)

Extremely clean, minimalistic, neon-styled UI

Dark theme with neon highlights (neon blue, neon green, purple)

Smooth UI animations and transitions


Features:

Landing Page (Home):

Eye-catching welcome screen

"Login" and "Sign Up" buttons

Typing text animation (Typed.js) for catchy text

AOS.js scroll-based animations


Login Page:

Proper login functionality using LocalStorage

Redirect to Dashboard after successful login

Alert for invalid login


Sign Up Page:

Proper signup functionality using LocalStorage

Redirect to Login page after successful signup

Alert for signup success/failure


Dashboard Page (after login):

Study Planner (select subjects, add topics, mark topics complete)

Daily Task Manager (add/edit/delete tasks, save to LocalStorage)

Countdown Timer to JEE Mains + Advanced (use correct future dates)

Progress Tracker (subject-wise visual progress bars)

Motivational Quotes Section (rotating daily)

Calendar View (user can add tasks per date)

Goal Tracker (set monthly/weekly goals, mark complete)

Leaderboard Placeholder (future expansion)


Settings Page:

Toggle Dark/Light Mode (default = Dark)

Edit profile name (stored in LocalStorage)

Reset all progress/tasks option



Technical Requirements:

Full JavaScript functionality implemented — no mockups

Use LocalStorage to store all user data (login, tasks, goals, calendar, progress)

Organized file structure:

/index.html (Landing page)

/login.html

/signup.html

/dashboard.html

/settings.html

/css/styles.css (All styles)

/js/app.js (All core logic)

/assets/ (icons/images if needed)


Include and configure:

Typed.js (for typing effect on landing page)

AOS.js (for scroll animations)


Fully responsive (desktop and mobile friendly)

Add defer attribute in <script> tags for proper loading

Project must be downloadable as ZIP and deployable directly on Netlify (without backend errors)
