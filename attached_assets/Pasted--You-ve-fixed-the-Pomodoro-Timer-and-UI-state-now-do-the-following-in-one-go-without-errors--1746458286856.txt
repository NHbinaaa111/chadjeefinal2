You've fixed the Pomodoro Timer and UI state — now do the following in one go, without errors:

🔥 1. Study Streak (Functional & Accurate)
Fixes needed:

Currently shows 0 Current Streak, 0 Longest Streak, 0 Total Days, even after sessions.

What to implement:

✅ A day counts as a "study day" if the user:

Completes at least one Pomodoro work session OR

Completes a test on that date.

✅ Track:

studyDates: array of ISO date strings (['2025-05-04', '2025-05-05'])

currentStreak: count of consecutive days ending with today

longestStreak: max length streak across all time

totalDays: count of unique study days

✅ On app load:

Recalculate all values from studyDates (use moment.js or date-fns)

✅ Save studyDates to localStorage or persistent DB (whichever system you're using)

✅ Display in the dashboard as:

yaml
Copy
Edit
🔥 Current Streak: 3 days
🏆 Longest Streak: 6 days
📅 Total Days: 8
📊 2. Smart Study Recommendations (Based on Tests & Sessions Only)
Fixes needed:

Currently shows made-up values like "372 days without Chemistry" even if user studied it recently.

Also, recommendations seem hardcoded or random.

What to implement:

✅ Track study/test activity by subject:

When a user completes a test, log { subject: 'Physics', date: '2025-05-05' }

When a user starts a Pomodoro, prompt/select a subject and log { subject: 'Chemistry', type: 'pomodoro', date: '2025-05-05' }

✅ For each subject (Physics, Chemistry, Math):

Calculate days since last activity

If inactivity > 3 days, generate a suggestion like:

"⚠️ You haven’t practiced Chemistry in 4 days. Consider revising Organic Reactions."

✅ Store subject logs in localStorage or DB and make sure it updates every time user completes session/test.

✅ Render recommendations dynamically on dashboard with correct icons.

🎯 Bonus: UX Feedback (Optional Enhancements)
For first-time users: show “No data yet” in streaks/recommendations if there's no history

Add refresh icon next to recommendations (already present but should reprocess data)

❗ Requirements
No hardcoded durations like "372 days"

No placeholder subjects like "Biology"

Dashboard must update in real-time after completing sessions/tests

No console errors, null state bugs, or visual mismatches

Once all this is done, we can finally move to analytics, performance tracking graphs, and heatmaps.

Let me know when this is implemented.
