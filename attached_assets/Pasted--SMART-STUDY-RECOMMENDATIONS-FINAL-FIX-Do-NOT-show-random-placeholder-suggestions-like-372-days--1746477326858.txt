✅ SMART STUDY RECOMMENDATIONS — FINAL FIX
Do NOT show random placeholder suggestions like “372 days since Organic Chemistry.” That is meaningless.

Check for actual data presence before showing anything. For each subject (Physics, Chemistry, Math), do the following:

If test records exist for the subject:
Find the latest test with that subject and:

If the score < 50%, and “area of improvement” is filled → show:

“You recently scored <score>% in <topic>. Review <area of improvement>.”

If the score is ≥ 50% → do not show a recommendation for that subject unless Pomodoro data applies.

If no relevant test data:
Then fall back to Pomodoro session history:

Show: “Last studied <subject> <X> days ago. Consider revising.”

If neither test nor Pomodoro data exists:
Show: “No data available yet for <subject>. Add a test or log a study session to see recommendations.”

✅ Also, ensure:

Study streak is correctly calculated

Remove all hardcoded "days since..." strings

Recommendations should auto-update when new tests or Pomodoros are logged

📊 ANALYTICS SECTION — FINAL IMPLEMENTATION
Add a new Overall Performance section with two dynamic charts using Recharts:

1. Test Score Trends Chart
Allow user to select:

Yearly / Monthly / Weekly views

Chart: Line or bar chart with x-axis = time and y-axis = score

Group scores by subject with different colors

If no test records exist for selected period, show:
“No test data available for this period.”

2. Study Hours Chart
Pull data from Pomodoro/study sessions

Same Year/Month/Week selection

Chart: Bar chart showing total hours per subject

If no study sessions exist for selected period, show:
“No study data available for this period.”

Other Requirements:
Responsive design

Type-safe with proper data handling

Empty states should be clear, not silent or broken

✅ Final Notes:

No placeholders. All recommendations and analytics must be based ONLY on actual data.

Don’t show irrelevant or misleading content

Dashboard must be clean, clear, and data-driven

Let me know when it's 100% complete and working, with screenshot proof.
