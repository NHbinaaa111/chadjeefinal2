The following issues need to be resolved completely and implemented correctly:

🔁 Pomodoro Timer Fixes
✅ The timer now persists across navigation, but:

When navigating away and back, it always shows the "Start" button, even if the timer is actively running.

🔧 Fix:

On component mount or context load, check whether the timer is still running using isRunning state or timestamp comparison.

If the timer is active, show the Pause button, not the Start button.

Resume countdown display from where it should be based on Date.now() - startTimestamp.

🔥 Study Streak Badge (Currently Not Functional)
The streak logic appears to be present but not working.

✅ Implement:

When a Pomodoro work session is completed, store the current date in localStorage or DB (studyDates = [2024-05-05, 2024-05-04, ...]).

On each app load:

Check how many consecutive past days exist in studyDates → that’s the current streak.

Also calculate longestStreak from stored data.

Display on dashboard:

txt
Copy
Edit
🔥 Current Streak: 4 days
🏆 Longest Streak: 7 days
🧠 Smart Study Recommendations (Make Functional + JEE-Specific)
✅ Currently shows irrelevant subject ("Biology") and may not be fetching or analyzing real data.

🔧 Fix:

Replace subjects list with actual JEE subjects only: ["Physics", "Chemistry", "Mathematics"]

Track session completion by subject (tie Pomodoro or goals to subjects)

Generate smart recommendations like:

“📌 You haven’t studied Chemistry in 3 days — revise Organic basics.”

“⚠️ Math sessions decreasing — consider solving PYQs today.”

Add subject-to-session linking:

When starting a Pomodoro session, let the user optionally select a subject

Store that data and use it in analysis

💡 Bonus: UI Polish (Optional but Useful)
Dashboard badges and recommendation cards should use meaningful icons and modern styling

Disable irrelevant subjects or placeholder content

Make dashboard dynamic: update study streak & suggestions in real-time without refresh

📦 Deployment-Ready Requirements
No UI mismatches (e.g., wrong button showing)

No state loss or reset bugs

No placeholder content (like Biology or Lorem Ipsum)

No console errors or crashes

Fully functional and persistent streak + recommendation logic
